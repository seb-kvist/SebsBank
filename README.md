# SebsBank Typescript Application
## Overview

SebsBank is a simple bank application built with TypeScript, where users can log in, check their balance, deposit and withdraw money. The application uses object-oriented programming (OOP) with custom classes to handle banking operations. The program features a menu with various options where users can interact with their account and view their transactions..

### Key Features:

- User Login: Ability to log in with a username and password. For testing purposes, there is a default user with the username "test" and password "test."
- Balance: View the current balance.
- Deposit and Withdrawal: Ability to deposit or withdraw money from the account.
- Menu: A menu that presents the user with four options:
    View balance
